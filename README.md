# Prediction Model for Hiring Decision

# Overview 
This repository contains the implementation of a predictive model designed to assist in hiring decisions. The model leverages machine learning techniques to evaluate candidate attributes and predict their suitability for a given position.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to enhance the hiring process by providing a data-driven approach to candidate selection, thus improving the efficiency and accuracy of recruitment decisions.

# Key Features
1. Data Preparation: Includes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts an in-depth analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
3. Modeling Techniques: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble methods like Voting and Stacking.
4. Feature Selection: Implements techniques to select the most relevant features for the model.
5. Sampling Methods: Applies oversampling and undersampling to address class imbalance in the dataset.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model parameters to enhance performance.
7. Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
